# youtube-dl-ad-skip
This is a shell script that uses Youtube-dl to download new files from a channel, and then utilises ffmpeg to find a known ad at the end of the video. If one of the ads is found, it creates a ComSkip edl file to tell the video player to skip the ad. I have developed and tested it on linux (Debian) only.  It currently scans mp4 files (only) for ads and expects the advertisement screenshots to be png files, just showing any frame from the ad (something distinct is best), and expects the filename to contain the length of the ad, like "advertA (34.5 seconds long).png".   It's pretty basic, but can be easily expanded to add more basic features, or even figure out the length of the ad on its own. But for me it works perfectly to skip the ads on TYT videos, which are so very annoying.
